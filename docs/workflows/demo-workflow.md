## Part 1: Introduction & Basic Workflow (2 minutes)

### Talk Track:

> "Welcome! Today I'm going to show you Atomic VCS's consolidating tags feature - a powerful way to manage dependencies in large codebases, especially when working with AI-assisted development.
>
> Unlike Git, Atomic doesn't use branches. Instead, it uses a DAG - a directed acyclic graph - where you have explicit control over dependencies. This gives you incredible flexibility.
>
> Let's start with a simple workflow. I'm going to create a small project and make a few changes."

### Commands:

```bash
# Show we're in a clean Atomic repository
pwd
ls -la
echo "# My Project" > README.md

# First change
atomic add README.md
atomic record -m "Initial commit - add README"

# Show what happened
echo "✓ Created first change"
echo ""

# Add some code
echo "def hello():" > app.py
echo "    print('Hello, World!')" >> app.py
atomic add app.py
atomic record -m "Add hello function"

# Add another feature
echo "def goodbye():" >> app.py
echo "    print('Goodbye!')" >> app.py
atomic record -m "Add goodbye function"

# Add tests
echo "def test_hello():" > test.py
echo "    assert hello() is not None" >> test.py
atomic add test.py
atomic record -m "Add tests for hello function"

# One more change
echo "def test_goodbye():" >> test.py
echo "    assert goodbye() is not None" >> test.py
atomic record -m "Add tests for goodbye function"
```

### Talk Track (during commands):

> "I've just created 5 changes. Each change builds on the previous one, which means dependencies are accumulating. Change 5 depends on changes 1, 2, 3, and 4. This is normal, but it can become a problem in large projects."

## Part 2: The Dependency Problem (1 minute)

### Talk Track:

> "Let me show you the dependency growth problem. As you make more changes, each one needs to reference ALL previous changes it depends on. This grows quadratically - O(n²) total dependencies across all changes.
>
> For a project with 100 changes, you're looking at thousands of dependencies. For 1000 changes? That's over a million dependency relationships to track.
>
> This is where consolidating tags come in."

### Visual Aid (optional):

```bash
# Show current state
echo "Current state:"
echo "  Change 1: 0 dependencies"
echo "  Change 2: 1 dependency (Change 1)"
echo "  Change 3: 2 dependencies (Changes 1, 2)"
echo "  Change 4: 3 dependencies (Changes 1, 2, 3)"
echo "  Change 5: 4 dependencies (Changes 1, 2, 3, 4)"
echo ""
echo "Total: 10 dependency relationships"
```

### Visual Aid - Dependency Growth Illustration:

```
Growth Pattern Without Consolidation:
────────────────────────────────────
Changes:  1    2    3    4    5    ...   100
Deps:     0    1    2    3    4    ...    99
          ──────────────────────────────────
Total:    0  + 1  + 2  + 3  + 4  + ... + 99 = 4,950 dependencies!

This grows as n(n-1)/2 - that's O(n²) complexity!
```

---

## Part 3: Creating a Consolidating Tag (2 minutes)

### Talk Track:

> "Now let's create a consolidating tag. This is like taking a snapshot of the current state. It represents all 5 changes we've made so far, but as a single reference point.
>
> Think of it like this: instead of saying 'I depend on changes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5', future changes can say 'I depend on tag v1.0' - which is equivalent, but much simpler."

### Commands:

```bash
# Create the consolidating tag
atomic tag create v1.0 --consolidate -m "Release 1.0 - Initial stable version"

# The output will show something like:
# MNYNGT2VGEQZX4QA43FWBDVYQY7CGXN4J2CGE5FDFIHOWQFKFIJQC (consolidating: 5 changes)
```

### Talk Track (after creation):

> "There we go! Tag v1.0 now consolidates all 5 changes. The important thing to understand is: we haven't deleted anything. All 5 changes are still in the database with their full history and dependencies. The tag is just a mathematical reference point."

### Commands:

```bash
# Show tag details
atomic tag list --consolidating

# Output explanation:
# - Consolidated changes: 5
# - Dependencies before: 10
# - Effective dependencies: 1
# - Dependency reduction: 9
```

### Talk Track:

> "Look at these numbers. We had 10 total dependency relationships before. Now, future changes can reference just this one tag instead. That's a 90% reduction in dependencies we need to track."

# Make a new change
echo "def status():" >> app.py
echo "    print('Running!')" >> app.py
atomic record -m "Add status function"

echo ""
echo "✓ Created Change 6"

### Talk Track:

> "Change 6 automatically depends on Tag v1.0. Behind the scenes, Atomic knows that means it has changes 1 through 5 in its history, but we only need to track one dependency. This keeps our dependency graph clean and fast.
>
> Remember: Atomic doesn't have branches or merges like Git. It's just a DAG - a directed acyclic graph - where each change explicitly lists its dependencies."

---

## Part 5: The Power Move - Inserting Changes (3 minutes)

### Talk Track:

> "Now here's where it gets really interesting. Let's say we discover a bug that should have been fixed earlier. Maybe it was in our hello function from way back in change 2.
>
> In Git, you'd have to rebase, which rewrites history. But in Atomic, we can INSERT a change into the middle of our history just by setting its dependencies explicitly. Watch this."

### Commands:

```bash
# Create a bug fix file
echo "# Bug fix for hello function" > bugfix.py
echo "def hello_fixed():" >> bugfix.py
echo "    # Fixed: added error handling" >> bugfix.py
echo "    return 'Hello, World!'" >> bugfix.py
atomic add bugfix.py

# Now the key: use -e to edit dependencies
atomic record -e -m "BUGFIX: Add error handling to hello function"
```

### Talk Track (while editor is open):

> "The editor opened with the change file. See that Dependencies section? It shows change 6 as the default - the latest change. But I'm going to change this.
>
> I want this bugfix to logically sit between change 2 (where we added hello) and change 3 (where we added goodbye). So I need to find the hash of change 2."

### In Editor (explain as you edit):

```toml
# Before:
# Dependencies
[0] <Change_6_hash> # Latest change

# After (change to):
# Dependencies
[0] <Change_2_hash> # Add hello function - we're fixing this one
```

### Talk Track (after saving):

> "I just inserted a change into the middle of our history! Change 2.5 now sits between change 2 and change 3.
>
> The beauty is: Tag v1.0 is IMMUTABLE. It still represents the original path through changes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Our bugfix created a parallel path. Now we have:
>
> - Path 1: C1 → C2 → C3 → C4 → C5 → Tag v1.0 → C6
> - Path 2: C1 → C2 → C2.5 (bugfix)
>
> Both paths exist simultaneously in the DAG."

## Part 6: Combining the Paths (2 minutes)

### Talk Track:

> "Of course, we want future development to include the bugfix. So let's create a change that depends on BOTH paths - the bugfix and the main development."

### Commands:

```bash
# Create a change that depends on both paths
echo "# Integration point" > integration.py
echo "# Brings together main dev and bugfix" >> integration.py
atomic add integration.py

# Use -e to specify BOTH dependencies
atomic record -e -m "Integrate bugfix into main development"
```

### In Editor (explain):

```toml
# Dependencies - this change has TWO dependencies
[0] <Change_2.5_hash> # The bugfix
[1] <Change_6_hash> # Latest main development
```

### Talk Track (after saving):

> "This change has TWO dependencies - it includes both the bugfix path and the main development path. There's no special 'merge' operation in Atomic. You just list the dependencies you want. It's explicit, visible, and in your control."

## Part 7: Creating a New Tag (1 minute)

### Talk Track:

> "Now let's create a new consolidating tag that includes our bugfix."

### Commands:

```bash
# Create v1.0.1
atomic tag create v1.0.1 --consolidate -m "Release 1.0.1 - with bugfix"

# List all tags
atomic tag list --consolidating
```

### Talk Track:

> "Watch what happens. Tag v1.0.1 automatically includes change 2.5! How? Because when creating a tag, Atomic traverses the DAG from the current tip. It follows all reachable changes, including our inserted bugfix.
>
> Let's look at the stats."

### Expected Output:

```
Tag: <v1.0_hash> (channel: main)
  Consolidated changes: 5
  Dependencies before: 10
  Effective dependencies: 1
  Dependency reduction: 9

Tag: <v1.0.1_hash> (channel: main)
  Consolidated changes: 7
  Dependencies before: 28
  Effective dependencies: 1
  Dependency reduction: 27
```

### Talk Track:

> "Tag v1.0.1 consolidates 7 changes - the original 5, plus the bugfix, plus the merge. We went from 28 dependency relationships down to 1. That's a 96% reduction!"

## Part 8: AI Attribution (Optional - 1 minute)

### Talk Track:

> "One more thing - if you're using AI assistance, Atomic tracks that too."

### Commands:

```bash
# Show attribution
atomic tag list --consolidating --attribution
```

### Talk Track:

> "You can see which changes were AI-assisted versus human-authored. This is crucial for compliance, auditing, and understanding your codebase's evolution. But that's a topic for another demo."

---

## Part 9: Wrap-Up (1 minute)

### Talk Track:

> "Let me summarize what we've seen:
>
> 1. **Consolidating Tags**: Reduce O(n²) dependencies to O(1) by creating snapshot reference points
>
> 2. **No Branches, No Merges**: Atomic uses a DAG with explicit dependencies - no Git-style branches or merge commits
>
> 3. **Insertion**: Use `atomic record -e` to insert changes anywhere by setting dependencies explicitly
>
> 4. **Immutability**: Tags never change - they're permanent snapshots
>
> 5. **Multiple Dependencies**: Changes can depend on multiple other changes - just list them in the dependencies section
>
> 6. **Automatic Consolidation**: New tags automatically include all reachable changes, even inserted ones
>
> This approach scales to massive codebases. Imagine a repository with 10,000 changes. Without consolidating tags, you're tracking millions of dependencies. With tags every 100 changes, you're tracking thousands.
>
> More importantly, this design works beautifully with AI-assisted development, where you might be making dozens or hundreds of changes per day. The dependency graph stays clean and manageable.
>
> **One note about team collaboration**: Regular tags in Atomic sync perfectly during push and pull. The consolidating tag feature stores additional metadata about these tags in the pristine database. This metadata should sync across repositories since it's part of the pristine database, but we recommend testing this in your specific setup. The underlying changes and regular tag markers always sync correctly.

## Note: Push/Pull Behavior 🔍

### Status: Needs Testing

The behavior of consolidating tags during push/pull operations needs verification in your environment.

**What We Know:**
- Regular tags (Merkle hashes) sync perfectly ✓
- Consolidating metadata is stored in pristine database
- Pristine database syncs during push/pull
- **Theory**: Metadata should sync with pristine database
- **Reality**: Needs testing to confirm

### Recommended Test

Before using in production, test this scenario:

```bash
# Repo A: Create tag
atomic init repo-a
cd repo-a
atomic record -m "Change 1"
atomic tag create v1.0 --consolidate -m "Release 1.0"
atomic tag list --consolidating  # Shows v1.0

# Push to remote
atomic remote add origin <remote-path>
atomic push origin main

# Repo B: Clone and check
atomic clone <remote-path> repo-b
cd repo-b
atomic tag list --consolidating  # Does it show v1.0?
```

### For Video

**Mention this honestly:**

> "Regular tags in Atomic sync perfectly. The consolidating tag feature stores additional metadata in the pristine database. Since the pristine database syncs during push and pull, this metadata should travel with it. However, if you're working with a team, I recommend testing this in your environment first to ensure consistency across repositories. The underlying changes and regular tag markers always sync correctly, so worst case, you can recreate the consolidating tags if needed."

### If Tags Don't Sync (Workaround)

```bash
# Document your tags in a script
cat > setup-tags.sh <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
atomic tag create v1.0 --consolidate -m "Release 1.0"
atomic tag create v1.0.1 --consolidate -m "Release 1.0.1"
EOF
chmod +x setup-tags.sh
```

## Visual Aids Summary for Graphics Team

### Recommended Animations to Create:

1. **Dependency Growth Animation** (Part 2)
   - Show nodes being added one by one
   - Animate dependency lines accumulating
   - Counter showing total dependencies growing: 0 → 1 → 3 → 6 → 10...

2. **Tag Creation Animation** (Part 3)
   - Show all 5 changes
   - Draw a circle around them
   - Transform into single tag node
   - Show "5 deps → 1 dep"

3. **Insertion Animation** (Part 5)
   - Show linear path C1→C2→C3
   - Pause at C2
   - Slide in C2.5 from the side
   - Show both paths existing simultaneously

4. **Multiple Dependencies Animation** (Part 6)
   - Show two parallel paths
   - Animate dependency arrows converging to C7
   - Highlight "2 dependencies" on C7
   - Show C7 as a regular change, not a special merge node

5. **Tag Expansion Animation** (Part 7)
   - Show Tag v1.0 as collapsed node
   - Click to expand → show C1-C5
   - Show traversal path with highlighted arrows
   - C2.5 gets picked up in the traversal

### Color Coding Suggestions:

- **Regular Changes**: Light blue circles
- **Consolidating Tags**: Gold/yellow hexagons
- **Inserted Changes**: Green circles
- **Changes with Multiple Dependencies**: Purple circles (not special, just has 2+ deps)
- **Dependencies**: Gray arrows
- **Active Path**: Bold blue arrows

## Video Production Tips

### Preparation:
1. **Terminal Setup**: Use a large font (18-20pt) with high contrast
2. **Screen Recording**: 1920x1080 minimum, 30fps
3. **Terminal Theme**: Light background for better video compression
4. **Slow Down**: Pause after each command to let viewers read
5. **Close-ups**: Zoom in on editor sections when explaining dependencies

### Pacing:
- **Introduction**: 30 seconds
- **Each demo section**: 60-90 seconds
- **Key concepts**: Repeat twice in different words
- **Terminal output**: Leave visible for 3-5 seconds

### Editing:
- Add text overlays for key concepts
- Highlight dependency sections in editor
- Use arrows/circles to point out important hashes
- Add "Before/After" graphics for DAG states

### Graphics to Add (Post-Production):
1. DAG visualization showing dependency growth
2. Before/After comparison of dependency counts
3. Visual representation of tag as snapshot
4. Animation showing change insertion

## Alternative: Shorter 5-Minute Demo

If 10 minutes is too long, use this condensed version:

1. **Intro (30s)**: What are consolidating tags
2. **Create 3 changes (60s)**: Quick setup
3. **Create tag (45s)**: Show consolidation
4. **Insert change (90s)**: Use `-e` to insert
5. **Create new tag (45s)**: Auto-includes inserted change
6. **Wrap-up (30s)**: Key benefits

Total: ~5 minutes

---

## Troubleshooting During Recording

**If a command fails:**
- Pause, fix it, then explain what went wrong
- This makes the demo more authentic
- Show how to recover from mistakes

**If you lose track:**
- Use `atomic log` to see current state
- Use `atomic tag list --consolidating` to see tags
- Reference this script

**Practice runs:**
- Do 2-3 dry runs before recording
- Time each section
- Identify potential stumbling points
